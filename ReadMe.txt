Description: 
The Tower of Hanoi puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883. He was inspired by a legend that tells of a Hindu temple where the puzzle was presented to young priests. At the beginning of time, the priests were given three poles and a stack of 64 gold disks, each disk a little smaller than the one beneath it. They could only move one disk at a time, and they could never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. 

Data Structure Used:
Stacks are the most appropriate data structure for this problem.

The problem was solved using following steps:
1.Move a tower of height-1 to an intermediate pole, using the final pole.
2.Move the remaining disk to the final pole.
3.Move the tower of height-1 from the intermediate pole to the final pole using the original pole.
